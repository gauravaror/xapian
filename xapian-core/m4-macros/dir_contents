<Description>
M4 macros to be installed with Xapian.
This currently just contains the macro for finding the parameters for
linking and including headers for an installed version.

Even though this is a single file, it needs to be in a subdirectory of the main
source tree so that compilation against an uninstalled xapian can add the
directory to the search path for aclocal without risking pulling in any other
*.m4 files (such as the aclocal.m4 found in the top level directory).
